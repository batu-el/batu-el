## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Batu, a first-year PhD student at Stanford University. In summer 2024, I graduated with an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge. Previously, I worked at the World Bank and co-founded Chember. You can check out my [website](https://batu-el.github.io/home/) for more.
